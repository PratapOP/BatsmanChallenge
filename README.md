# BatsmanChallenge
This repository contains a Python-based cricket simulation game where players take on the role of a batsman. The game challenges you to choose your batting style—Defensive, Balanced, Aggressive, or Brute—each with unique probabilities for scoring runs or getting out. Track your performance with real-time updates on runs scored, balls faced, and strike rate after every ball. The game also maintains records, including your highest score, total runs, average, milestones like 50s and 100s, and even ducks. Perfect for cricket enthusiasts looking for a fun and engaging way to test their batting strategy!
